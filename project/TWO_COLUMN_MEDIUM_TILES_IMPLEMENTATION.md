# Two-Column Medium Tiles Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how both the Class Selection and Subject Selection screens now display medium tiles in a 2-column layout for better mobile viewing experience.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. CSS Grid Layout
Both screens use the same grid layout system:
```css
.selection-grid, .class-grid, .subject-grid, .chapter-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* Two columns */
    gap: 15px;
    padding: 15px 5px;
    max-width: 100%;
}
```

### 2. Medium Tile Card Styling
All selection cards use consistent medium tile styling:
```css
.selection-card {
    padding: 20px 15px; /* Reduced padding for medium tiles */
    min-height: 120px; /* Reduced height for medium tiles */
    /* ... other styles preserved ... */
}
```

### 3. Responsive Text Sizing
Font sizes optimized for medium tiles:
- Card icon: `2rem` (reduced from 3rem)
- Card title (h3): `1.1rem` (reduced from 1.6rem)
- Card subtitle (h4): `0.9rem`
- Card description (p): `0.8rem`
- Card badge: `0.7rem`

## Implementation Details

### JavaScript Functions
Both screens use the same card creation pattern:

**Class Selection Screen (`renderClassGrid()`):**
- Creates `selection-card class-card` elements
- Uses `.class-grid` container
- Each card represents a class level

**Subject Selection Screen (`renderSubjectGrid()`):**
- Creates `selection-card subject-card` elements  
- Uses `.subject-grid` container
- Each card represents a subject

### CSS Class Hierarchy
```
.class-grid / .subject-grid (Grid Container)
  └── .selection-card (Grid Items - Medium Tiles)
      ├── .card-icon
      ├── h3 (Title)
      ├── p (Description)
      └── .card-badge
```

## Visual Features

### 2-Column Layout
- Each row displays exactly 2 cards
- Cards are equal width and height
- Consistent spacing between cards

### Medium Tile Design
- **Height**: 120px (compact but readable)
- **Icon Size**: 2rem (proportional to card size)
- **Typography**: Optimized font sizes for readability
- **Spacing**: Balanced padding and margins

### Interactive Effects
- **Hover**: 3D rotation and color change to green
- **Click**: Active state with green gradient
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and shine effects

## Browser Compatibility
- Works on all modern browsers
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes

## Testing Verification
To verify both screens work correctly:

1. **Login** → Select any board (e.g., CBSE)
2. **Class Selection Screen**: Should show 2 columns of medium-sized class cards
3. **Subject Selection Screen**: Should show 2 columns of medium-sized subject cards
4. **Navigation**: Both screens should maintain consistent tile appearance

## Technical Notes
- CSS Grid ensures automatic wrapping to new rows
- Flexbox fallback for older browsers
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-friendly minimum target sizes (44px)
- High contrast and accessibility compliant

The implementation ensures both Class Selection and Subject Selection screens provide a consistent, mobile-optimized experience with clean 2-column medium tile layouts.
